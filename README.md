A set of text tools written in Python for editing Obisidan note pages. Interfaces with the Citations Zotero plugin. Allows for renaming of files, reorganising properties (including tags), and more customisation options. Intended for personal use, so no documentation, and limited generalisability of code.

To use this repo, clone and then modify the values in the constants.py folder. The main piece of useful code will be the ObsidianArticle class, which is run on an obsidian page with properties. Code may need to be modified depending on the specific formatting of your Obsidian article files.
